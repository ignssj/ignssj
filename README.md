I'm Ignacio, a Software Engineer who thrives on the joy of building things. Holding a degree in Computer Engineering from Universidade Federal do Pampa, I have acquired a solid foundation in various aspects of computer science and discovered my true passion for software development along the way.

Throughout my academic journey, I have nurtured a deep interest in software development, algorithm design, and system architecture. These areas have not only sharpened my skills but also fueled my curiosity to explore new technologies and find innovative solutions to complex problems.

Feel free to explore my repositories and delve into my projects. I always embrace collaborations, discussions, and opportunities to learn from fellow developers and enthusiasts. If you have any questions or simply want to say hello, please don't hesitate to reach out!
